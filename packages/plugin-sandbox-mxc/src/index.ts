/**
 * @prismshadow/penguin-plugin-sandbox-mxc — a Windows sandbox backend over Microsoft
 * MXC (Microsoft eXecution Containers).
 *
 * A PLUGIN PACKAGE, not part of the platform: a deployment lists it in plugins.json and
 * the harness resolves it from the installation. It compiles against the type-only
 * `@prismshadow/penguin-server/plugin` surface and has no runtime dependency on the
 * harness or on any other backend.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: Windows has no bubblewrap and no sandbox-exec, and the DSH adaptor's
 * Windows rung (restricted tokens + ACLs) governs file writes only. MXC's
 * `processcontainer` backend is the one mechanism that expresses all three dimensions
 * of this harness's sandbox interface on Windows, and it maps onto them directly:
 *
 *   fs-write    → filesystem.readwritePaths / readonlyPaths
 *   mask-paths  → filesystem.deniedPaths
 *   network     → network.allowOutbound: false  (MXC's default is already deny)
 *
 * WINDOWS ONLY, deliberately. MXC also carries Linux (bubblewrap/LXC) and macOS
 * (Seatbelt) backends, but this harness already ships native, live-verified plugins for
 * those; declaring them here too would only add an untested second path to a solved
 * problem. On any non-Windows host this backend declines and the routing moves on.
 *
 * The SDK is an OPTIONAL PEER DEPENDENCY, loaded through a dynamic import for the same
 * reason the DSH adaptor loads its chain that way: it carries ~40MB of per-platform
 * binaries plus a native pty module, so only a deployment that actually wants it pays
 * for it, and an installation missing it surfaces as an unavailable capability (the
 * sandbox service then fails closed for a confining policy) rather than a broken boot.
 *
 * COUPLING SURFACE, stated because MXC is Public Preview and its schema may move before
 * 1.0. Beyond the published `buildSandboxPayload`/`getPlatformSupport` API this backend
 * relies on exactly two internals, both verified against 0.7.0 and both asserted in the
 * tests: the runner is `bin/<arch>/wxc-exec.exe` inside the SDK package, and it takes
 * the whole config as `--config-base64 <base64 JSON>` with the command inside the
 * config (which is what lets an argv-rewriting seam host it at all — there is no
 * trailing argv to append).
