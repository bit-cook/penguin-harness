/**
 * Plugin loading: WHICH plugins a deployment runs is CONFIGURATION, not capability
 * baked into the platform.
 *
 * Plugins therefore do not ride the platform bundle and are not delivered by a hot
 * push — the list lives in `<root>/plugins.json` and each entry is resolved against
 * the INSTALLATION, so installing or upgrading a backend is an install-side action.
 * That is exactly the property the sandbox needed: its backends (the DSH adaptor,
 * bubblewrap) are packages a deployment chooses, and the harness itself does not
 * depend on any of them.
 *
 * Resolution is anchored at `process.argv[1]` — the entry the host process was started
 * with — for the same reason the packaged bundle's own resolver is (see
 * scripts/deploy.mjs and platform/agent-cli-path.ts): a platform bundle running from
 * `hmr/store` has no node_modules of its own, and anchoring at the bundle's location
 * would find nothing. A plain specifier import is the fallback for dev checkouts.
 *
 * Failure is per-entry and non-fatal: an unresolvable or malformed plugin is reported
 * and skipped, leaving the capabilities it would have provided unavailable (the sandbox
 * service then fails closed for a confining policy) rather than failing the boot.
