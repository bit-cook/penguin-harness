/**
 * @prismshadow/penguin-plugin-sandbox-bwrap — a bubblewrap sandbox backend.
 *
 * A PLUGIN PACKAGE, not part of the platform: a deployment lists it in plugins.json and
 * the harness resolves it from the installation (see the server's plugins/loader.ts).
 * It compiles against the type-only `@prismshadow/penguin-server/plugin` surface and
 * carries no runtime dependency on the harness — and none on the DSH ecosystem either:
 * it talks to `bwrap` directly and implements every dimension of the sandbox interface,
 * including the two DSH's vocabulary does not cover.
 *
 * The bwrap profile is built in order, because bwrap applies mounts in order and a
 * later mount shadows an earlier one:
 *
 *   --ro-bind / /  --dev /dev  --proc /proc  --die-with-parent   the read-only world
 *   [workspace-write]  --tmpfs /tmp  --bind <workspaceRoot> <same>
 *   [network: none]    --unshare-net                             no network namespace
 *   [mask-paths]       --tmpfs <dir> | --ro-bind /dev/null <file>  shadowing the above
 *   --  <the caller's argv>
 *
 * Masking is why order matters: the entries must come after the read-only bind of `/`
 * that would otherwise expose them. A path that does not exist is skipped — there is
 * nothing to hide, and materializing an empty directory there would change the
 * filesystem view rather than restrict it.
 *
 * Known limitation, verified live: `--unshare-net` gives the process an empty network
 * namespace (its /proc/net/dev holds only `lo`, and nothing resolves or connects), but
 * `/sys` still arrives through the read-only bind of `/`, so `/sys/class/net` keeps
 * listing the HOST's interfaces. Network ACCESS is enforced; host network topology
 * remains readable as stale metadata. Mask it explicitly with `maskPaths` if that
 * matters for a deployment.
