/**
 * Reading `~/.ssh/config` — the only source of remote targets. We never write it, never
 * keep a host list of our own, and never re-implement OpenSSH's matching rules: this module
 * does exactly two things, both pure so they unit-test without a filesystem or an ssh binary.
 *
 * 1. `parseHostAliases` scans the config text for candidate aliases, following `Include`
 *    through a caller-supplied reader. It exists only because OpenSSH has no "list hosts"
 *    command and the UI needs something to show. Pattern entries (`*`, `?`, `!`) are skipped:
 *    they configure other hosts rather than name one.
 * 2. `parseSshSettings` reads the output of `ssh -G <alias>`, which is OpenSSH's own answer
 *    to "what does this alias actually resolve to" — Match blocks, Include, wildcard
 *    inheritance and defaults all already applied.
