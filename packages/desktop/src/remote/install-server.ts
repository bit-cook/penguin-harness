/**
 * Installing this build's server onto another machine, VS Code Remote style: ask the machine
 * what it is, fetch the matching Node runtime, push both it and the install image, and let a
 * Node installer do the rest. No CLI surface — this is the desktop app's own capability,
 * driven from the menu (see menu.ts).
 *
 * Nothing here assumes anything about the far side except an sshd and, for four commands, a
 * shell of some kind. In particular it does NOT use install.sh: that is a POSIX script, and a
 * Windows host cannot run it. The remote gets a runtime of ours at `lib/runtime`, so it does
 * not need Node installed either — which is also why the runtime has to be fetched per
 * platform and arch, and why the identity probe comes first.
 *
 * The remote is left with exactly what a local install leaves: the program directory
 * (`~/.local/share/penguin`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\penguin`) and, on POSIX, the `~/.local/bin/penguin`
 * symlink. No sudo, no service units, no profile edits, and the data directory is untouched.
