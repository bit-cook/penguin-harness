/**
 * @prismshadow/penguin-plugin-sandbox-dsh — the DeepSeek Harness sandbox ecosystem
 * behind this harness's own sandbox interface.
 *
 * A PLUGIN PACKAGE, not part of the platform: a deployment lists it in plugins.json and
 * the harness resolves it from the installation (see the server's plugins/loader.ts).
 * The DSH dependencies live HERE, in this package — the harness itself does not depend
 * on them, which is what "plugins are configuration, not built-in capability" means in
 * dependency terms.
 *
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sandbox-local` carries the platform chain (dsh-bwrap → Landlock on
 * Linux, Seatbelt on macOS, the ACL restricted-token runner on Windows) and probes them
 * functionally; this file translates between its vocabulary and ours. Because DSH's
 * policy vocabulary governs file-write effects only, the adaptor declares exactly
 * `fs-write` — the service therefore never routes a network / mask-paths policy here,
 * and the adaptor never has to drop a dimension it cannot honor.
 *
 * Everything DSH loads behind the dynamic imports below, and that is load-bearing for
 * hot push (see scripts/deploy.mjs): the package reaches native-adjacent modules that a
 * pushed single-file bundle resolves from the installation, so an installation missing
 * them fails THIS load — reported fail-closed by the service — instead of failing the
 * whole platform bundle's import.
