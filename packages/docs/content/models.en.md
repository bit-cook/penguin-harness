title: Models & Providers
description: Model access through the single AgentHub gateway, (provider, model_id) identity, the per-Project model table, credentials and thinking levels.
---

## One gateway

All model access goes through one gateway library: `@prismshadow/agenthub` (AutoLLMClient). Core defines only a thin `LLMInterface` (see [Interfaces](/interfaces)); per-provider protocol adaptation happens inside AgentHub, so 1000+ online and local models are reachable, including any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The protocol translation lives in `packages/core/src/llm/generative-model.ts`.

## Model identity

A model's identity is always the `(provider, model_id)` pair: `provider` is a config group name, `model_id` the upstream request id sent to AgentHub unchanged. The two are independent fields — concatenating them into one string is forbidden anywhere in the pipeline.

Every interface that names a model takes the complete pair: the CLI, the HTTP API, and the SDK all reject half a reference instead of completing it. The provider is never inferred from the model id and has no default, because gateways resell vendor models under their upstream ids — a guessed group would send the entry's credential to a vendor nobody named. Where a model reference is optional at all (`penguin run` / `chat`, Session creation, Schedules), the choice is between the whole pair and nothing: omit both halves to take the Project's default model.

## The per-Project model table

Each Project's available models are recorded in the hidden `.project_config.toml`, maintained via the CLI (`penguin config model add / default / list`, see [CLI Reference](/cli)) or the Web UI — never hand-edited. `ModelEntry` fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `provider` | Config group name; paired with `model_id` it forms the unique key |
| `model_id` | Upstream request id |
| `context_window` | Context window (tokens). Load-bearing, not just display: each request's effective output cap and the compaction threshold are derived from it, so requests never ask for more output than the window still fits. Unset (or implausibly small, under 4096): the output clamp turns off and compaction derives from an assumed 128000 — set the real value for models with smaller windows |
| `max_tokens` | Optional per-model output cap (max output tokens per request). When set it overrides the Agent's `model.max_tokens`; unset inherits it. The cap is a ceiling, not the literal wire value: each request sends `min(max_tokens, context_window − estimated input − safety margin)`, so small-window models work without hand-tuning it. Omitting the field on a Web full-table save clears it |
| `client_type` | Protocol hint (e.g. `openai`); inferred by AgentHub from the model id when omitted |
| `display_name` | Display name |
| `vision` | Whether image input is supported, default true |
| `pricing` | Three price buckets (unit `usd_per_mtok`, USD per million tokens): `cache_read` / `cache_write` / `output` |
| `api_key` / `base_url` | Inlined credentials, both optional; when blank, AgentHub falls back to environment variables |

A fresh Project defaults to deepseek-v4-flash. A `vision_model` entry can additionally designate the proxy model that `describe_image` uses for text-only session models (see [Tools & Approval](/tools)); it is unset by default.

File shape (illustrative):

```toml
default_model = { provider = "deepseek", model_id = "deepseek-v4-flash" }
vision_model = { provider = "google", model_id = "gemini-3.1-pro-preview" }

[[models]]
provider = "deepseek"
model_id = "deepseek-v4-flash"
context_window = 1000000

[[models]]
provider = "custom"
model_id = "my-model"
client_type = "openai"
base_url = "https://llm.example.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."
```

For a model tagged `vision = false` (e.g. the DeepSeek series), images from conversation input are saved to the Session scratchpad and handed over as a file path spliced into the text, and the image-reading tool switches to `describe_image`.

## Built-in provider groups

Built-in groups and their env-var fallbacks (catalog source: `packages/core/src/state/model-catalog.ts`); each group also has a `_BASE_URL` variant (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`):

| Provider | API key env var | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| deepseek | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | Group of the default model |
| openrouter | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI-compatible gateway, preset base URL `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` |
| fireworks | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Fireworks AI (OpenAI-compatible), preset base URL `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1`; API model ids look like `accounts/fireworks/models/<slug>` |
| siliconflow | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI-compatible gateway, preset base URL `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1` |
| qwen-token-plan | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Qwen Token Plan subscription gateway, preset base URL `https://token-plan.cn-beijing.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`; pricing from each model page's official list price (the preview model has only a quota-multiplier promo, no list price) |
| qwen-pay-as-you-go | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Qwen pay-as-you-go (DashScope's OpenAI-compatible endpoint), preset base URL `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`; resold third-party models keep vendor-prefixed ids (e.g. `kimi/kimi-k3`) |
| google | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | |
| anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | |
| openai | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | |
| zhipu | `ZAI_API_KEY` | |
| moonshot | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` | |
| custom | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Any OpenAI-protocol endpoint |

The gateway groups (openrouter / fireworks / siliconflow / qwen-token-plan / qwen-pay-as-you-go) go through AgentHub's OpenAI client, so with blank credentials they read `OPENAI_API_KEY` — not a gateway-specific variable.

The preset catalog also carries OpenRouter's free tier: `:free` model variants (e.g. `inclusionai/ling-3.0-flash:free`, `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free`) and the `openrouter/free` unified Free Models Router. They cost nothing, but are subject to OpenRouter's free-tier rate limits and data policy.

Some models in the preset catalog: deepseek-v4-pro / deepseek-v4-flash, gemini-3.1-pro-preview, claude-opus-4-8 / claude-sonnet-4-6, gpt-5.5, glm-5.2, kimi-k2.6, qwen3.8-max (not exhaustive).

## Local / self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoints (e.g. vLLM)

A local inference server is just a `custom` entry: `client_type = "openai"`, `base_url` pointing at the server (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1`), and the served model name as `model_id`. Two settings make it run smoothly:

- **Enable tool calling server-side.** For vLLM, start the server with `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and the `--tool-call-parser` matching your model (e.g. `hermes` for Qwen, `llama3_json` for Llama 3.x); without them tool calls arrive as plain text and the agent loop cannot execute anything.
- **Set the entry's `context_window` to the server's real window** — for vLLM, the `--max-model-len` value (e.g. `32768`). The per-request output cap and the compaction threshold both derive from this window automatically: requests clamp `max_tokens` to what the window still fits, and compaction fires before the window overflows, so no hand-tuned `max_tokens` is needed. Left unset, the per-request output clamp is off and compaction assumes a 128000 window, so a smaller real window will reject requests.

## Thinking levels

Five levels: `none | low | medium | high | xhigh`, configured per Agent as `model.thinking_level` in `system_config.yaml`, default medium. The Web pickers offer `low` and above only (many models cannot disable thinking; `none` stays a valid stored value and still displays). The chat draft view offers a quick picker next to the model selector: a picked level is written back to the selected Agent's setting immediately (the switched-to level becomes that Agent's new default and applies from the next session). Inside an active session the thinking level is a **per-turn parameter**: the composer's picker lists only the levels and starts out showing the Agent config's level — while the user hasn't picked one it auto-follows the config (sends omit the level, so config edits keep taking effect); once picked, the level sticks for that session and rides on every subsequent send (it applies to that session's subsequent Tasks only and never writes back to the Agent config). See [Configuration](/configuration).

One provider constraint outranks the picked level. Reasoning models reached over an OpenAI-compatible API (DeepSeek and the relays in front of it) require every assistant turn in the history to bring its `reasoning_content` back with a thinking-mode request, and reject the whole request with a 400 otherwise: `The reasoning_content in the thinking mode must be passed back to the API.` The level is per-turn but the history is shared by the whole context, so a context can hold turns that carry no reasoning at all — a turn run at `none`, a Session resumed at a level its recorded turns never ran with (the thinking level is deliberately not a Session invariant, see [Sessions & Traces](/sessions-and-traces)), or a provider that returned no reasoning for one turn. The first such rejection takes thinking off the wire for **that context**: the request is reported as `failed`, the engine's own retry re-issues it with thinking disabled — which the unchanged history is always valid for — and the run continues, with one line on stderr naming the reason. Committed history is never rewritten to fake the missing reasoning. The configured level returns as soon as a new context starts: after a compaction, or in a new session.

## Models decoupled from Agents

An Agent never binds a model: the model is chosen when a Session is created and stays locked for that Session; the same Agent can run different Sessions on different models. The in-session `/model` command changes models handoff-style: it opens a new session for the same Agent on the new model, keeping the current Workspace, whose first message carries a `[model_switch_from]` source block (the source session id and its Trace file path) — the history is not injected into the new context (some models require thinking payloads and `fidelity` on history replay, which cannot cross models); the model reads the Trace file itself when it needs it, and the source session stays untouched. The three `pricing` buckets feed the usage/cost center's per-Token accounting.

Credential handling:

- an inline `api_key` is stored in the hidden Project config file with mode 0600;
- the Web UI masks it on display;
- blank credentials fall back to the provider's environment variables.

## Connectivity test

The Web Models page offers a per-model connectivity test (owner only).
