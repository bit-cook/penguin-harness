/**
 * @prismshadow/penguin-plugin-sandbox-seatbelt — a macOS Seatbelt sandbox backend.
 *
 * A PLUGIN PACKAGE, not part of the platform: a deployment lists it in plugins.json and
 * the harness resolves it from the installation. It compiles against the type-only
 * `@prismshadow/penguin-server/plugin` surface and has no runtime dependency on the
 * harness or on any other backend.
 *
 * Seatbelt is the macOS counterpart to bubblewrap here, and it expresses all three
 * dimensions of the sandbox interface natively — as POLICY rules rather than mounts:
 *
 *   (allow default)                                 start from the host's world
 *   (deny file-write*)                              nothing is writable…
 *   (allow file-write* (literal "/dev/null") …)     …beyond the required sinks
 *   [workspace-write] (allow file-write* (subpath <root>) …)
 *   [network: none]   (deny network*)
 *   [mask-paths]      (deny file-read* file-write* (subpath <p>))
 *
 * Rule ORDER is the counterpart to bwrap's mount order: in SBPL the LAST matching rule
 * wins, so the mask denials are emitted after the write allowances — otherwise masking
 * a path inside the workspace would be overridden by the workspace's own allowance.
 *
 * Paths are canonicalized before they enter the profile: Seatbelt matches the real
 * filesystem path, and on macOS `/tmp` and `/var` are symlinks into `/private`, so an
 * uncanonicalized subpath rule silently matches nothing.
 *
 * `sandbox-exec` is deprecated by Apple but ships on every macOS; if it ever stops
 * working, the probe below is what turns that into a fail-closed refusal rather than an
 * unconfined run.
